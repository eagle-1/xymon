 \section{NAME}
 Hobbit web page headers, footers and forms. 

  
\section{DESCRIPTION}
 The Hobbit webpages are somewhat customizable, by modifying the header- and footer-templates found in the ~hobbit/server/web/ directory. There are usually two or more files for a webpage: A \textbf{template\_header}
 file which is the header for this webpage, and a \textbf{template\_footer}
 file which is the footer. Webpages where entry forms are used have a \textbf{template\_form}
 file which is the data-entry form. 

  With the exception of the \textbf{bulletin}
 files, the header files are inserted into the HTML code at the very beginning and the footer files are inserted at the bottom. 


  The following templates are available: 


 \begin{description}
\item[bulletin] A \textbf{bulletin\_header}
 and \textbf{bulletin\_footer}
 is not shipped with Hobbit, but if they exist then the content of these files will be inserted in all HTML documents generated by Hobbit. The ``bulletin\_header'' contents will appear after the normal header for the webpage, and the ``bulletin\_footer'' will appear just before the normal footer for the webpage. These files can be used to post important information about the Hobbit system, e.g. to notify users of current operational or monitoring problems.
