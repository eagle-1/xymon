\section{NAME}
 \hgcmd{bbcmd} - Run a Hobbit command with environment set  \section{SYNOPSIS}
\textbf{bbcmd --env=ENVFILE COMMAND}


  
\section{DESCRIPTION}
\emph{bbcmd(1)} is a utility that can setup the Hobbit environment
variables as defined in a \emph{hobbitlaunch(8)} compatible
environment definition file, and then execute a command with this
environment in place. It is mostly used for testing extension scripts
or in other situations where you need to run a single command with the
environment in place. 


The ``--env=ENVFILE'' option points bbcmd to the file where the
environment definitions are loaded from. 



COMMAND is the command to execute after setting up the environment. 

If you want to run multiple commands, it is often easiest to just use
``sh'' as the COMMAND - this gives you a sub-shell with the
environment defined globally.
