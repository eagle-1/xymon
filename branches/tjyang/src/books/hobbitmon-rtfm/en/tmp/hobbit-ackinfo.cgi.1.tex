 \section{NAME}
 hobbit-ackinfo.cgi - Hobbit CGI script to acknowledge alerts  \section{SYNOPSIS}
\textbf{hobbit-ackinfo.cgi}


  
\section{DESCRIPTION}
\textbf{hobbit-ackinfo.cgi}
 is invoked as a CGI script via the hobbit-ackinfo.sh CGI wrapper. 

  hobbit-ackinfo.cgi is used to acknowledge an alert on the Hobbit ``Critical Systems'' view, generated by the \emph{hobbit-nkview.cgi(1)}
 utility. This allows the staff viewing the Critical Systems view to acknowledge alerts with a ``Level 1'' alert, thereby removing the alert from the Critical Systems view. 


  Note that the Level 1 alert generated by the hobbit-ackinfo.cgi utility does \textbf{NOT}
 stop alerts from being sent. 


  In a future version of Hobbit (after Hobbit 4.2), this utility will also be used for acknowledging alerts at other levels. 


  
\section{OPTIONS}
\begin{description}
\item[--level=NUMBER] Sets the acknowledgment level. This is typically used to force a specific level of the acknowledgment, e.g. a level 1 acknowledge when called from the Critical Systems view. 

 

\item[--validity=TIME] Sets the validity of the acknowledgment. By default this is taken from the CGI parameters supplied by the user. 

 

\item[--sender=STRING] Logs STRING as the sender of the acknowledgment. By default, this is taken from the loginname of the webuser sending the acknowledgment. 

 

\item[--env=FILENAME] Loads the environment defined in FILENAME before executing the CGI script. 

 

\item[--area=NAME] Load environment variables for a specific area. NB: if used, this option must appear before any --env=FILENAME option. 

 

\item[--debug] Enables debugging output. 

 


\end{description}
 \section{ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES}

\item[BBHOME] Used to locate the template files for the generated web pages.
