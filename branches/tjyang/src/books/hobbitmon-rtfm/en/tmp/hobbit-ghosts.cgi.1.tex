\section{NAME}
 hobbit-ghosts.cgi - CGI program to view ghost clients  \section{SYNOPSIS}
\textbf{hobbit-ghosts.cgi}


  
\section{DESCRIPTION}
\textbf{hobbit-ghosts.cgi} is invoked as a CGI script via the hobbit-ghosts.sh CGI wrapper. 

  It generates a listing of the Hobbit clients that have reported data
  to the Hobbit server, but are not listed in the \emph{bb-hosts(5)}
  file. Data from these clients - called ``ghosts'' - are ignored,
  since Hobbit does not know which webpage to present the data on. 



  The listing includes the hostname that the client reports with, the
  IP-address where the report came from, and how long ago the report
  arrived. 



  By far the most common reason for hosts showing up here is that the
  client uses a hostname without a DNS domain, but the bb-hosts file
  uses the hostname with the DNS domain. Or vice versa. You can then
  use a \textbf{CLIENT} setting in the bb-hosts file to match the two
  hostnames together.
