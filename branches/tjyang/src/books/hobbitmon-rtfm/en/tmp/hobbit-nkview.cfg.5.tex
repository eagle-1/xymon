 \section{NAME}
 hobbit-nkview.cfg - Configuration of the hobbitgraph CGI 

  
\section{SYNOPSIS}
\textbf{\$BBHOME/etc/hobbit-nkview.cfg}


  
\section{DESCRIPTION}
\emph{hobbit-nkview.cgi(1)}
 uses the configuration file \$BBHOME/etc/hobbit-nkview.cfg to determine which of the statuses currently in a red or yellow state should appear on the Critical Systems view. 

  This file should not be edited manually. It is maintained by the \emph{hobbit-nkeedit.cgi(1)}
 utility via a web-based frontend. 


  
\section{FILE PERMISSIONS}
 Since the file is maintained by a web front-end tool, the userid running Web CGI scripts must have write-permission to the file. Typically, this means it must have a group-ownership matching your webserver userid, and group-write permissions (mode 664). 

  When editing the file with the web front-end, a backup file is created. Therefore the hobbit-nkview.cfg.bak file should have identical permissions.
