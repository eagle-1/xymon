* Hobbit_Animation1.gif, Hobbit_Animation2.gif
  By Martin Parrott <parrottm (at) charter.net>
  If you copy these to the ~hobbit/server/www/gifs/ directory, 
  you can change the "HOBBITLOGO" setting in hobbitserver.cfg to 
      HOBBITLOGO="<img src=$BBSKIN/Hobbit_Animation1.gif>"
  and have them shown instead of the "Hobbit" text shown at the top
  of each Hobbit webpage. 

* clustered_hobbit_installation.txt
  By Brian Lynch <brianlynch (at) gmail.com>
  Describes how to setup a cluster of two Hobbit servers in an
  active/passive scenario, using Linux-HA clustering.

* citrix.zip
  Extension script for BBNT (the MS-Windows BB client) for a
  Citrix server. Uses the "query session" command to determine
  the number of active users and feeds this into Hobbit where
  it will show up as a "citrix" graph.

* ntpstat.sh
  Client-side extension to feed data about the local NTP daemon
  to Hobbit. Hobbit tracks the offset between the local clock
  and the NTP reference clock in the "ntpstat" graph.

* hobbit-html.sh
  A script to add the Hobbit menu-line to static HTML documents,
  e.g. if you have custom docs in the Hobbit "help" directory.
