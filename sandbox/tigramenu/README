Tigra Menu system for Xymon
===========================

Xymon versions prior to 4.3.0 used the Tigra menu system from
http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/

Since the licensing for this was always a bit unclear, this
menu system was removed from Xymon 4.3.0. Instead, a menu
based on CSS and HTML 4 was added.

However, this does not work with Internet Explorer 6. So if
you must use this very old and insecure browser, then you
can install the Tigra menu system instead of the default
Xymon menu.

To do so:

1) Copy all of the files in www/menu/ to your ~xymon/server/www/menu/
   directory. Note that the "tigramenu_items.js" file contains
   URL's that may be different in your Xymon installation, so adapt
   this as needed. Any custom menus go into this file.

2) Copy web/tigramenu_footer to your ~xymon/server/web/ directory.

3) Modify these settings in hobbitserver.cfg (if not present, just
   add these lines):
      XYMONBODYHEADER=""
      XYMONBODYFOOTER="file:$BBHOME/web/tigramenu_footer"
      XYMONBODYMENUCSS="$BBMENUSKIN/tigramenu.css"

4) Restart Xymon
