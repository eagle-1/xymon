.SH NAME
criticalview.cgi \- Xymon Critical Systems view CGI
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "criticalview.cgi"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcriticalview.cgi\fR is invoked as a CGI script via the 
criticalview.sh CGI wrapper.

criticalview.cgi matches the current critical statuses against the
.I critical.cfg(5)
file, and generates the "Critical Systems" view. 

.SH RELATION TO OLD CRITICAL PAGE
This view is a replacement for the statically generated "critical" page 
provided in versions of Xymon prior to version 4.2. Although the 
"critical" pages are supported throughout Xymon 4.x, it is recommended 
that You switch to the newer Critical Systems view provided by this CGI.
