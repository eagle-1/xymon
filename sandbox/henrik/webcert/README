Webcert tool
============

This is a tool to help with ordering and processing SSL certificates.
It is intended for use by a group of people who receive orders for
SSL certificates, pass them on to the Certificate Authority (Verisign,
Thawte, Comodo ...), and then return the issued certificates to
the requestor once they have been received.

An extra feature is that the tool can issue certificates automatically
using a local CA to sign the certificate.

It uses various bits and pieces from the Xymon library.


Setup
-----
1) Create a directory where the requests will be stored:
     # mkdir /var/ca
     # mkdir /var/ca/{newcerts,private,requests}
     # mkdir /var/ca/requests/{new,cur,done}
     # chown -R www-data:www-data /var/ca

2) Setup the local CA (run these commands as the user owning /var/ca):
   Note: This creates a CA whose root certificate is UN-encrypted. Dont do
   this on a system where security matters.
     $ cd /var/ca
     $ openssl req -new -x509 -keyout private/CAkey.rsa -out private/CAcert.pem
     Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
     ..........++++++
     .++++++
     writing new private key to 'private/CAkey.rsa'
     Enter PEM pass phrase: <enter your passphrase>
     Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: <enter your passphrase again>
     -----
     You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
     into your certificate request.
     What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
     There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
     For some fields there will be a default value,
     If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

     $ openssl rsa -in private/CAkey.rsa -out private/CAkey.pem
     Enter pass phrase for private/CAkey.rsa: <enter your passphrase>
     writing RSA key
     $ echo "01" >serial
     $ touch index.txt

3) Copy the "openssl.cnf" file from the source directory to /var/ca
