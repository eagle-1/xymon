This is a couple of tools used at CSC/Copenhagen for managing 
SMS notifications by our helpdesk staff. There are two programs:

1) smsqueue looks at the spool directory /var/spool/smsgui
   and calls /usr/local/bin/handleguisms to transmit an SMS
   when it is due.
2) smsadmin.cgi is a web-interface using some Xymon library
   routines for managing the spool directory (adding new
   SMS's, deleting old ones, handling recipient lists etc).

The spool directory must be writable by the userid running
your webserver.

Access to the tool is controlled by the webserver.

The spool directory has the following structure:

  /var/spool/smsgui
     user1/		<-- one directory per user
     user2/
       active/		<-- holds the active sms's
         smsNNNNN/		<-- unique, per message
	   endtime
	   info
	   lastxmit
	   log
	   message
	   recips
	   repeat
       old/		<-- holds the old sms's
       recips/		<-- holds recipient lists
           recip1
	   recip2


Contents of the smsXXXXX directory
----------------------------------
The "endtime" file is timestamped in the future - this is
when the SMS will automatically be removed from the active
list. The file contents is the original lifetime in seconds.

"info" is a text summary of the sms, shown in the web UI.

"lastxmit" is empty, the timestamp tells when the SMS was last
sent.

"log" is a text log of events that have happened with this
SMS (created, sent, modified, ...)

"message" is the contents of the SMS.

"recips" is the name of the recipient, it points to a file in 
the "recips/" directory.

"repeat" is how often the SMS is repeated, in minutes. If
this value is negative, the message has been suspended.


Contents of the recips directory
--------------------------------
Each file holds a list of SMS recipients, in the form
   PhoneNumber Description
If the phonenumber is "%", then the description is a pointer
to another list, so you can have lists inside lists.

The filename is the name of the recipient list. This is what
an SMS's "recips" file points to.
